                    Pommy is a productivity app that helps you stay focused on your tasks. It is a simple app that allows you to create tasks and set timers for them. Pommy is based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
